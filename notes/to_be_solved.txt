-----------------------
TO DO RIGHT NOW!!!
-----------------------
0. Distinguish violations

1. Violation Masking
    New tuning is masked by previous violation

2. e_number range
    initial range for integer and float

3. Discuss with Yuqi about cyber recorder
    record files need to extract obstacles, ego car routing waypoints, traffic light signal
    cyber records no routing_request. Cannot play routing request. Can play perception.
    It seems cyber play just replays information, but not reload new configurations. You don't even have to launch modules.

4. Discuss with Yuqi about code coverage (Branch coverage)

5. Check and Finish the rest of violation types





-----------------------
Important but follow schedule
-----------------------
1. Run AV Testing techniques (scenoRITA, DoppelTest, AV-Fuzzer, ADFuzz) (GA, DRL, T-way)
2. T-way testing
3. Static Analysis
    Variable dependency
    Option range: Partial path sensitive analysis or interval analysis
4. Traffic Lights
5. Get as many scenarios as possible from scenario generation approaches, reduce a reasonable number of scenarios by filtering.
    Initial Scenarios-diversity of vehicle maneuver, traffic controls, code coverage, violation types...
    filtering scenarios
        threshold - mutable size
        ranking - get top 10
6. Eliminate duplicate:
    similarity of duplicate	refer to scenoRITA
    clustering algorithm to eliminate duplicate at last
    Think about how to eliminate duplicate in the optimization process - comparison



-----------------------
Not so hurry
-----------------------
1. Provide cases that identify a bug, and then fix the bug
0. Deep Reinforcement learning
2. Avoid generating the obstacles overlapped with the ego car
3. Avoid generating the ego car above the stop sign line
4. Genetic algorithm implementation.
    use existing implementations (e.g., deap framework)
5. replay record by obstacle information & routing request
6. Fail to detect bicycle collision
    scenoRITA can
    DoppelTest cannot
7. Conversion of maps of Apollo to LGSVL
    Use the common maps
8. Why scenoRITA works on large maps but DoppelTest not so good â€“ say something in the proposal how to solve this issue
    How much time it need to take for DoppelTest to get enough good scenarios
    Test it for more hours
