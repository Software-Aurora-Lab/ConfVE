Need Discussion

?. run configuration reverting
    still violated after reverting?
    if tune it back, what's the significance of genetic algorithm?

?. Violation Masking
    New tuning is masked by previous violation
    Fix: configuration reverting? or (option tuning, violation pair) or eliminate this individual after detecting
        Once we found optimal, eliminate?
    give weights to every option tuned. report possibility of each option to cause violations instead of focusing on single option

    What should we do after detecting violations?

? Optimal individual
    Only occurred when configuration caused module failure in all scenarios


-----------------------
TO DO RIGHT NOW!!!
-----------------------
0. Distinguish violations
    violation features

    Eliminate duplicate
    similarity of duplicate	refer to scenoRITA
    clustering algorithm to eliminate duplicate at last
    Think about how to eliminate duplicate in the optimization process - comparison

0. Under some configurations, some scenarios can successfully start, some scenarios cannot
    In those cannot start, it didn't report planning module failure

0. Traffic Lights

1. Code coverage
    significance: cover more code blocks that could reflect more option tuning.
    otherwise, some option tunings would never influence the system

2. Check and Finish the rest of violation types




-----------------------
Important but follow schedule
-----------------------
1. Run AV Testing techniques (scenoRITA, DoppelTest, AV-Fuzzer, ADFuzz, Random) (GA, T-way)
2. T-way testing
3. Static Analysis
    Variable dependency
    Option range: Partial path sensitive analysis or interval analysis




-----------------------
Not so hurry
-----------------------
1. Provide cases that identify a bug, and then fix the bug
2. Avoid generating the obstacles overlapped with the ego car
3. Avoid generating the ego car above the stop sign line
4. Genetic algorithm implementation.
    use existing implementations (e.g., deap framework)
5. Fail to detect bicycle collision
    scenoRITA can
    DoppelTest cannot
6. Conversion of maps of Apollo to LGSVL
    Use the common maps
7. Why scenoRITA works on large maps but DoppelTest not so good â€“ say something in the proposal how to solve this issue
    How much time it need to take for DoppelTest to get enough good scenarios
    Test it for more hours
8. Deep Reinforcement learning
