0. Store the configuration files of final results and option tuning situation
0. Store and analyze the violation remove/emerge info
1. Check and Finish the rest of violation types
2. Deep Reinforcement learning
3. Run AV Testing techniques (scenoRITA, DoppelTest, AV-Fuzzer, ADFuzz) (GA, DRL)

4. Code coverage (Branch coverage)
5. Finish fitness calculation function

0. The image of Dreamview is static after running many scenarios (Maybe bridge is disconnected?) (Restart the dreamview to fix this, maybe not the bridge issue)

1. Tuning ranges for options

---------------------
1. avoid generating the obstacles overlapped with the ego car
2. avoid generating the ego car above the stop sign line
3. replay record by obstacle detection & routing request


Discussion. Time latency, Non-determinism

scenoRITA problem:
1. Fast acceleration includes the max acc limit (>=), DoppelTest doesn't (>)
