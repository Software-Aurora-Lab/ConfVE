X. Static Analysis
x. Fail to detect collision (bicycle)
x. replay cannot reflect the configuration changes
x. Planning module failure not detecting
x. Add a report about configuration options tuning
x. Test scenoRITA results: replay records and run process again to see what's the difference
x. Store the configuration files of final results and option tuning situation

1. Check and Finish the rest of violation types
2. Deep Reinforcement learning
3. T-way testing
4. Run AV Testing techniques (scenoRITA, DoppelTest, AV-Fuzzer, ADFuzz) (GA, DRL)

5. Partial path sensitive analysis or interval analysis
6. Code coverage (Branch coverage)
7. Finish fitness calculation function

8. The image of Dreamview is static after running many scenarios (Maybe bridge is disconnected?) (Restart the dreamview to fix this, maybe not the bridge issue)
9. Tuning ranges for options

---------------------
1. avoid generating the obstacles overlapped with the ego car
2. avoid generating the ego car above the stop sign line
3. replay record by obstacle detection & routing request


---------------------
No routing request but have routing response ()
