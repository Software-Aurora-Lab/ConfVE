-----------------------
TO DO RIGHT NOW!!!
-----------------------
1. Static Analysis
    Variable dependency
    Option range: Partial path sensitive analysis or interval analysis





-----------------------
Design Modification (Also record it in notebook!)
-----------------------
1. Focus on bug emergence, don't focus on bug removal currently

2. Tuning ranges for options
    Gene representation
    Overall Identification

3. Identify invalid configurations
    invalid ranges of options
    Invalid tuning that removes violation but introduces new violations--Masking violations

    Add a report about configuration options tuning
    Store the configuration files of final results and option tuning situation
    Why planning module fails, focus on options that lead to module failure
    Specify which options would result in/highly related to specific violations

4. Start with as many scenarios as possible, to reduce a reasonable the number of scenarios.
    Initial Scenarios-diversity of vehicle maneuver, traffic controls, code coverage, violation types...

5. Eliminate duplicate:
    similarity of duplicate	refer to scenoRITA





-----------------------
Important but follow schedule
-----------------------
1. Check and Finish the rest of violation types
2. Deep Reinforcement learning
3. T-way testing
4. Run AV Testing techniques (scenoRITA, DoppelTest, AV-Fuzzer, ADFuzz) (GA, DRL)
6. Code coverage (Branch coverage)





-----------------------
Not so hurry
-----------------------
1. Provide cases that identify a bug, and then fix the bug
2. avoid generating the obstacles overlapped with the ego car
3. avoid generating the ego car above the stop sign line
4. Genetic algorithm implementation.
    use existing implementations (e.g., deap framework)
5. replay record by obstacle information & routing request
6. Fail to detect bicycle collision
    scenoRITA can
    DoppelTest cannot
7. Conversion of maps of Apollo to LGSVL
    Use the common maps
8. Why scenoRITA works on large maps but DoppelTest not so good â€“ say something in the proposal how to solve this issue
    How much time it need to take for DoppelTest to get enough good scenarios
    Test it for more hours
