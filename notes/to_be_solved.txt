?. Check and Finish the rest of violation types
    More types
        speeding - speed violation threshold
        lane change at junction
        unsafe lane change
        (brake taps) threshold
            some configurations run with a very low speed. Collision. How to distinguish this violation?
    Validate current types
        planning module failure - module is running. received message but module doesn't normally work
        Under some configurations, some scenarios can successfully start, some scenarios cannot
        In those cannot start, it didn't report planning module failure

?. what if planning module failure was caused by not launching planning module normally
    not caused by config file but launching itself

?. multi-objective fitness function
    how to change fitness function

?. Non-determinism is an important thing in virtual testing

?. why speeding violation sometimes happens in scenario1, sometimes not.

?. check scenario2 stop sign violation, why it often happens for first time running


-----------------------
TO DO RIGHT NOW!!!
-----------------------
?. load new records if finding bug-revealing violations in previous scenarios

1. bug-revealing violations judge

1. Distinguish violations
        module failure - ([option id list], violation results)
    Eliminate duplicate
        similarity of duplicate	refer to scenoRITA
        clustering algorithm to eliminate duplicate at last
        Think about how to eliminate duplicate in the optimization process
             comparison similarity of features?

2. test code coverage
    use it to select initial scenarios
    significance: cover more code blocks that could reflect more option tuning.
    otherwise, some option tunings would never influence the system

3. Scenarios-diversity
    Get as many scenarios as possible from scenario generation approaches, reduce a reasonable number of scenarios by filtering.
    Initial Scenarios---diversity of vehicle maneuver, traffic controls, code coverage, violation types, lane coverage...
    filtering scenarios
        threshold - mutable size
        ranking - get top 10






-----------------------
Important but follow schedule
-----------------------
1. Run AV Testing techniques (scenoRITA, DoppelTest, AV-Fuzzer, ADFuzz, Random) (GA, T-way)
    different maps and same recording time
        AV-Fuzzer - San Francisco
        DoppelTest - borregas_ave, san_mateo, sunnyvale_loop
        scenoRITA - borregas_ave, san_mateo
2. T-way testing
3. Static Analysis
    Variable dependency
    Option range: Partial path sensitive analysis or interval analysis
4. check violations are highly potentially bug-revealing
    semi-manual-automated way
5. let Tuan and Xiang analyze violated record.



-----------------------
Not so hurry
-----------------------
0. record uses code instead of process
0. Frameratio value control
1. Provide cases that identify a bug, and then fix the bug
2. Avoid generating the obstacles overlapped with the ego car
3. Avoid generating the ego car above the stop sign line
4. Genetic algorithm implementation.
    use existing implementations (e.g., deap framework)
5. Fail to detect bicycle collision
    scenoRITA can
    DoppelTest cannot
6. Conversion of maps of Apollo to LGSVL
    Use the common maps
7. Why scenoRITA works on large maps but DoppelTest not so good â€“ say something in the proposal how to solve this issue
    How much time it need to take for DoppelTest to get enough good scenarios
    Test it for more hours
8. Deep Reinforcement learning
9. configuration definition
    config files
    configurations in the source code (https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/issues/14550)
10. speed up scenarios
11. change it into "TwinTest"
    run one scenario under default configuration, run the same scenario under changed configuration
12. keep experiment running to get valid range
