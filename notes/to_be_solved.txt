TO DO RIGHT NOW!!!
-----------------------
-----------------------
Design Modification (Also record them on notebook!)
-----------------------
1. Configuration reverting: Tune it back in the optimization process
    Compare with non-reverting - measure the number of unique violations

2. Tuning ranges for options
    Gene representation
    Overall Identification

3. Identify invalid configurations
    invalid ranges of options
    Invalid tuning that removes violation but introduces new violations--Masking violations

    Add a report about configuration options tuning
    Store the configuration files of final results and option tuning situation
    Why planning module fails, focus on options that lead to module failure
    Specify which options would result in/highly related to specific violations

4. Get as many scenarios as possible from scenario generation approaches, reduce a reasonable number of scenarios by filtering.
    Initial Scenarios-diversity of vehicle maneuver, traffic controls, code coverage, violation types...
    filtering scenarios
        threshold - mutable size
        ranking - get top 10

5. Eliminate duplicate:
    similarity of duplicate	refer to scenoRITA
    clustering algorithm to eliminate duplicate at last
    Think about how to eliminate duplicate in the optimization process - comparison





-----------------------
Important but follow schedule
-----------------------
x. Run AV Testing techniques (scenoRITA, DoppelTest, AV-Fuzzer, ADFuzz) (GA, DRL, T-way)
1. Code coverage (Branch coverage)
2. Check and Finish the rest of violation types
3. T-way testing
4. Static Analysis
    Variable dependency
    Option range: Partial path sensitive analysis or interval analysis
5. Traffic Lights





-----------------------
Not so hurry
-----------------------
1. Provide cases that identify a bug, and then fix the bug
0. Deep Reinforcement learning
2. Avoid generating the obstacles overlapped with the ego car
3. Avoid generating the ego car above the stop sign line
4. Genetic algorithm implementation.
    use existing implementations (e.g., deap framework)
5. replay record by obstacle information & routing request
6. Fail to detect bicycle collision
    scenoRITA can
    DoppelTest cannot
7. Conversion of maps of Apollo to LGSVL
    Use the common maps
8. Why scenoRITA works on large maps but DoppelTest not so good â€“ say something in the proposal how to solve this issue
    How much time it need to take for DoppelTest to get enough good scenarios
    Test it for more hours
