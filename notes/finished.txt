x. Configuration reverting: Tune it back in the optimization process
    Compare with non-reverting - measure the number of unique violations
    In order to get more unique violations (unique option-violation pairs)

x. Tuning ranges for options
    Gene representation
    Overall Identification

    Identify invalid configurations
    invalid ranges of options
    Invalid tuning that removes violation but introduces new violations--Masking violations

x.  Add a report about configuration options tuning
    Store the configuration files of final results and option tuning situation
    Why planning module fails, focus on options that lead to module failure
    Specify which options would result in/highly related to specific violations

x. Select ratio

x. e_number range

x. output range analysis at last

x. Extract adc_routing and obs from record messages
    publish obs through channel
