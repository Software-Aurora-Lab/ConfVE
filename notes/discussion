1. cyber recorder
    record files need to extract obstacles, ego car routing waypoints, traffic light signal
    cyber records no routing_request. Cannot play routing request. Can play perception.
    It seems cyber play just replays information, but not reload new configurations. You don't even have to launch modules.

2. traffic lights

3. Scenarios-diversity
    Get as many scenarios as possible from scenario generation approaches, reduce a reasonable number of scenarios by filtering.
    Initial Scenarios---diversity of vehicle maneuver, traffic controls, code coverage, violation types...
    filtering scenarios
        threshold - mutable size
        ranking - get top 10

4. Eliminate duplicate
    violation features

    eliminate at last or in the process?


5. Violation types
    More types
    Validate current types
        planning module failure
            module failure - module is running. received message but module doesn't normally work

        collision
            fail to report collision. ego car stops in line, obstacle runs over it. all modules work
