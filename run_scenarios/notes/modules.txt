Routing map need to be generated every time changing the configuration file in the routing module since the options are routing map related. Once the routing map is generated, the turning type is determined.


Dreadview, Routing (Planning, Prediction) modules have to be relaunched every time we modify the routing configurations since the routing map have to be reloaded.

Graph package in the routing module seems to be used in the navigation mode. Not triggered during simulation.




How to test the subsequent source codes such as the routing_component.cc after we send the routing request.
